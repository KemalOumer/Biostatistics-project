Biostatistics final project 
Data Analysis Project: First Steps Intervention Program to Reduce Risk of Low Birth Weight
In this project, you will use the tools discussed in class to analyze infantsâ€™ birthweights from a 
sample in King County after the introduction of the First Steps (FS) program. Your data 
analyses should be systematic statistically and scientifically and statistically appropriate. You 
are assessing whether participation in the First Steps program increases birthweight, and you will 
make a recommendation to the board of Public Health King County based on your results. 
Write your report as though you are addressing the board of Public Health. Include an 
abstract, very brief Introduction, Results and Discussion, along with your recommendations. A 
partial template for the report is given in the guide below, but you are NOT restricted to this 
verbage.
The data file is BirthweightsKingCounty2001-Biost514-517-2022.txt. We first recommend 
examining the data in Excel to make sure the data are not obviously corrupted, that each column 
has a header, and to see how many rows/observations to expect. You should find N=2500. Read 
the data into R and check the resulting matrix for size.
